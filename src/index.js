import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'

import App from './components/App'

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('container'))

// Create two components, one called NavBar and one Called App

// Our NavBar should just have a title on it
// For now, our App component should just render our NavBar component

// HINT: We are using Babel and Webpack - how do we import other modules using ES6 syntax?
